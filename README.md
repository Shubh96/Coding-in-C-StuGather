# Coding in C [StuGather]

This repository contains the codes which are  part of a playlist in my YouTube channel available at [Basic Computing and Principles of C Programming (MAKAUT))](https://goo.gl/pkBvQo). These codes can be used for reference if you miss out somewhere through the video but try and do the coding by yourself else it is not going to help out anyways.

As of now all the files hae been named same as the name of the video, you might have a little tough time searching for it, but soon all the files will be renamed and numbered properly so searchin becomes easier.
